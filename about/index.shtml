	<p style="font:13px/16px Trebuchet MS">My first real experience with photography was in college.  I was majoring in Instructional Technology and Telecommunications at Western Illinois University, and photography was one of the required classes.  I really enjoyed the class, and did quite well.  The instructor was surprised to learn that I had never taken a photography class before.</p>
	<p>I didn't start taking photos until a year a half later, when I got a camera for graduation.  It was a Fuji FinePix S7000.  It was a great camera to get started on, and I found out how much I enjoyed doing photography as a hobby.</p>
	<p>Early 2006, I moved up to an SLR, the Canon Digital Rebel XT.  By this time, I had also started selling some stock photography.</p>
	<p>I have photographed a wide range of things: nature, macro, sports, night, church events, family portraits, and a couple weddings.  I have found that outdoor photography is what I enjoy the most.</p>
	<p>I currently live in a suburb of Indianapolis, and have been a member of the Riviera Camera Club since 2006.  I work full-time as a web designer, as well as do a bit of freelance work.</p>
