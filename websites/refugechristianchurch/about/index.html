	<p>Refuge Christian Church is located just northeast of  Noblesville, Indiana -- the county seat of one of the fastest growing counties in the state. (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=refuge+christian+church&amp;sll=40.056292,-86.016294&amp;sspn=0.142166,0.421257&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11&amp;ll=40.060731,-85.939865&amp;spn=0.284312,0.617294&amp;om=1">See Map</a>) This is a great place to live and to worship.  While we have no delusion of perfection, it remains our constant goal to be faithful to God's desires and plans for us as well as to be aware of the needs and hurts of our members.</p>
	<p>We are an independent congregation in the sense that we do not belong to any conferences or governing organizations.  We are a self-governing congregation, choosing our own leaders, missionaries to support, and programs to develop.</p>
	<p>Our programs are ever-increasing and ministries ever-growing.  Please click on the links in the side column to get an overview of our church.  Then we'd love to have you visit us for worship this Sunday.  Worship time is at 9:30 a.m. and Sunday School is at 11:00 a.m.</p>
	
	<h3 class="highlight">Vision Statement</h3>
	<p>The vision of Refuge Christian Church is to maintain our strength as a friendly congregation with sound and relevant teaching while being willing to adapt and restructure our services and programs to benefit as many as possible.  Our desire is not only to strengthen the convictions of those who believe in Jesus Christ but also to reach those who have yet to accept the grace of God.</p>
	<h3 class="highlight">Mission Statement</h3>
	<p>Refuge Christian Church, a non-denominational church based on New Testament teachings and traditions, exists to make Christ known to our community while continuing to support world evangelism.  We shall provide opportunities for Christians to grow in their knowledge of and obedience to Christ</p>
