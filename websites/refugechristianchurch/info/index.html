	<h3 class="highlight" id="worship">Worship</h3>
	<p>Our blended worship service begins at 9:30am every Sunday morning, featuring a combination of contemporary music and hymns. The staffed nursery is available throughout the entire service, and children leave for children's church immediately following the special music.</p>
    <p>The Children's church program (Pre-school- 6th Grade) strives to teach the students that the Bible is not only applicable to this present day, but also essential. There are fresh lessons planned every week with an emphasis on learning the lessons that the Bible teaches us. With both a worship time and a discussion time we endeavor to teach kids how to interact with their faith rather than just passively listening.</p>
    <p>This is followed by children's Sunday School</p>
	<h3 class="highlight" id="adult_ss">Adult Sunday School</h3>
	<p>Several adult sunday school classes are available.</p>
	<h3 class="highlight" id="youth">Youth Group</h3>
