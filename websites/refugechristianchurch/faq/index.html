	<p>We hope this page will help to answer some questions you may have.  If you would like to ask about something that is not listed here, please e-mail Stan.</p>

	<p class="highlight" onclick="toggle('question1')">What are your basic beliefs?</p>
	<div id="question1" style="display: none;"><p>We believe that Jesus, the Son of God, was born of a virgin; that He lived a sinless life, but yet loved us enough to pay the price for our sins through death on the cross; that He overcame death and the grave by resurrecting on the third day; that His Great Commission of going into all the world, preaching, making disciples, and baptizing applies to all who will follow Him.  We believe that acceptance of Jesus Christ is the means of eternal life in Heaven and that one's acceptance involves FAITH, REPENTANCE, CONFESSION, BAPTISM, AND CONTINUATION with Christ's help in the Christian life.  We believe the Bible is God's inspired Word given to us to help us know how to live now and how to prepare for eternity.  We believe that Jesus is coming again as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</p></div>
	
	<p class="highlight" onclick="toggle('question2')">Why do you call yourselves an "independent" church?</p>
	<div id="question2" style="display: none;"><p>We are independent in the sense that we do not belong to any conferences or governing organizations.  We are a self-governing congregation, choosing our own leaders (Elders, Deacons, Minister, etc.), missionaries to support and programs to implement.</p></div>
	
	<p class="highlight" onclick="toggle('question3')">Who "runs" this church?</p>
	<div id="question3" style="display: none;"><p>Ultimately we strive to look through the Bible to Jesus Christ for our authority in the church.  However, we do have leaders who are chosen by the congregation and compose our church board.  Our leaders, elders, and deacons, are chosen according to the guidelines of 1 Timothy and Titus.  Church leaders are elected for one year with re-election possible at the end of each year.</p></div>
	
	<p class="highlight" onclick="toggle('question4')">Why communion every Sunday?</p>
	<div id="question4" style="display: none;"><p>One of the important features of the meetings of the early church was partaking of the Lord's Supper, also called Communion.  The bread represents Christ's broken body and the fruit of the vine represents His shed blood.  Acts 20:7 relates that on the first day of the week, Sunday, the Christians shared in the Lord's Supper.  It is a time of remembrance of Christ's sacrifice and of self-examination of one's own life.</p></div>
	
	<p class="highlight" onclick="toggle('question5')">Why baptize by immersion?</p>
	<div id="question5" style="display: none;"><p>We strive to follow the examples set in the Bible in regard to baptism.  The Greek word (the New Testament was originally written in Greek) for baptism is baptizo, meaning "to immerse" or "to dip, plunge, or submerse."  Baptism itself is the beautiful picture of dying with Christ and putting the old sinful nature to death (going under the water) and rising, as Christ arose, a new person (coming out of the water.)</p></div>
	
	<p class="highlight" onclick="toggle('question6')">Where do offerings go?</p>
	<div id="question6" style="display: none;"><p>Tithes and offerings that are given are used to pay the minister's salary, for worship and educational materials, the upkeep and expansion of the building and grounds, the purchase of supplies, utilities, and a mission and benevolent program.</p></div>
	
	<p class="highlight" onclick="toggle('question7')">What do you have for children?</p>
	<div id="question7" style="display: none;"><p>We have an active Children's church program (Pre-school- 6th Grade) that strives to teach the students that the Bible is not only applicable to this present day, but also essential. There are fresh lessons planned every week with an emphasis on learning the lessons that the Bible teaches us. With both a worship time and a discussion time we endeavor to teach kids how to interact with their faith rather than just passively listening.</p>
    <p>Our Sunday School program follows Children's Church.</p>
    <p>We have a program called Family Time for our pre-K through K kids and families.  It is usually held on the second Sunday of the month.  There is a lesson and worship time.  Fun for the family.</p>
    <p>Tuesday nights that it is not raining we have our Elemental elementary program at Forest Park.  On the volleyball pits behind the Skate Park we have a short program that includes a lesson and a game.  This begins at 7pm.  Also during this time is O.F.F. (Outdoor Family Fun) from 6:30-8:30 which is just a time for the family to come out and play in the park.</p></div>
	
	<p class="highlight" onclick="toggle('question8')">What extra study programs do you offer?</p>
	<div id="question8" style="display: none;"><p>Not only do we offer a wide range of Sunday School programs for all ages, but we also offer several small group Bible studies. In addition to those we also have a Saturday morning Men's Breakfast and Bible Study, a Monday night Men's Bible Study at Noble Coffee and Tea, and a Wednesday Night Ladies' Bible Study that meets most of the year.</p>
    <p>Our Teens have Bible Studies throughout the week.  You can access the teen website at <a href="http://www.refugeteen.com">refugeteen.com</a></p></div>
	
	<p class="highlight" onclick="toggle('question9')">Why should I attend Refuge Christian Church?</p>
	<div id="question9" style="display: none;"><p>We believe that we are a Bible-based, people oriented, caring Church.  We try, to the best of our ability, to extend the joy, the compassion, the message, and the hope of Christ.  We desire that people grow in the knowledge of Christ and the Bible and therefore encourage participation in the various programs of study and fellowship.  By no means are we perfect, but we are striving to be what God wants us to be.</p></div>
	
	<p class="highlight" onclick="toggle('question10')">How can I be of use at Refuge Christian Church?</p>
	<div id="question10" style="display: none;"><p>We have a variety of committees and programs that people such as you have helped to build.  If you willing to be used, we have a place of service for you.</p></div>
	
	<p class="highlight" onclick="toggle('question11')">How do I become a member?</p>
	<div id="question11" style="display: none;"><p>If you are already an immersed believer, you may join by indicating your desire to do so to the minister.  If you've never repented of past sins, confessed Christ as Savior, and been immersed into Him, please consider these important and necessary steps in identifying with Christ and the Church.</p></div>
