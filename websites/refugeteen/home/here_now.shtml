<p class="boldMe">IMPORTANT!!!  The Wednesday and Thursday Bible Studies will be combining and moving to Nathan's house at 6pm on Wednesday nights.  If you have any questions feel free to call.</p>

<p>The ICYC spots have been reserved but I only have 15 and a handful are already spoken for.  Your spot is not reserved until I get the $50 for the trip.</p>

<p>There will be a retreat for HS Juniors and Seniors as well as college age people that we are going to participate in January 16-17.  Another youth pastor has asked me to lead worship for it as well as help with speaking.  So we will be making a trip.</p>
<p>Looks like the 30-Hour Famine will be February 13-14.</p>
