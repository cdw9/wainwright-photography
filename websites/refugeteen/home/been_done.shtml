	<p>Noblesville's fall break was last weekend.  Here's what I got from them:</p>
    <p><strong>Alyssa</strong> - "Well&hellip;Thursday I got 10 inches of hair cut off so that I could donate it. Friday I had basketball in the morning and then helped my friend Allie find a costume for a party she was going to (she went as Hillary Clinton). Saturday I had SATs in the morning, and then went to cross country state to see how we did (we got 8th) Today I am donating blood doing all the homework that I put off, and applying to more colleges :]</p>
    <p><strong>Trent</strong> - Didn't send me anything, but he raked the leaves at Grandpa's house, came into the office, and went to a concert in Columbus with Logan S. and Shelbie.</p>
    <p><strong>Shelbie</strong> - Didn't send anything in, but I know she went to a concert in Columbus.</p>
    <p>Other than that, it was a slow week.</p>
