    <p class="boldMe">Week of November 2 - November 8</p>	
    <p>This week we will be delving into prayer as part of our understanding of spiritual growth.  I look forward to it.  I think our study of how the Bible relates to spiritual growth last week was top notch.</p>
    <p>We are going over a topic I like to call "What is Spiritual Growth, and What is Not?" It's just as it sounds. We will be looking over a variety of different answers that have statistically been used to define Spiritual Growth. We are trying to nail down this tricky idea of what spiritual growth looks like, what it means, and what you should look for in it.</p>

    <p>We are going to begin looking at what the idea of Spiritual Growth is this week.  What does this concept entail, what do we think it entails?  We hear about it a lot, we know that we are supposed to grow in Christ, but what does that look like?  I look forward to this discussion, I hope you do as well.</p>

    <p>We are still working our way through the Sermon on the Mount.  I really love this section of scripture.  Its got so much "meat".  My, oh my though, it is tough to put into practice.  Last week we looked at the blessings, or the Beatitudes.  This week we're focusing more on some application stuff.</p>

    <h3>Mark 7:1-23</h3>
    <p>1The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and 2saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were "unclean," that is, unwashed. 3(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. 4When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.) </p>
    <p>5So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?" </p>
    <p>6He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: " 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. 7They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' 8You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men." </p>
    <p>9And he said to them: "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions! 10For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' 11But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God), 12then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. 13Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that." </p>
    <p>14Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. 15Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.' " </p>
    <p>17After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. 18"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? 19For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean.") </p>
    <p>20He went on: "What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' 21For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, 22greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. 23All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.' "</p>
    
    <h3>John 8:1-11</h3>
    <p>1But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. 3The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group 4and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?" 6They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. </p>
    <p>But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. 7When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her." 8Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. </p>
    <p>9At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?" </p>
    <p>11"No one, sir," she said. "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave your life of sin."</p>

    <h3>Matthew 21:23-27</h3>
    <p>23Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?" </p>
    <p>24Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 25John's baptism-where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" </p>
    <p>They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?' 26But if we say, 'From men'-we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet." </p>
    <p>27So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Then he said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</p>
    
    <h3>Matthew 23:25-28</h3>
    <p>25"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. 26Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean. </p>
    <p>27"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. 28In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.</p>

    <h3>Luke 9:18-27, 57-62</h3>
    <p>18Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?" </p>
    <p>19They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life." </p>
    <p>20"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God." </p>
    <p>21Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. 22And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life." </p>
    <p>23Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. 24For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. 25What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self? 26If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. 27I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."</p>
    <p>57As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go." </p>
    <p>58Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head." </p>
    <p>59He said to another man, "Follow me." But the man replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father." </p>
    <p>60Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God." </p>
    <p>61 Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family." </p>
    <p>62Jesus replied, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."</p>
    
    <h3>Luke 14:28-33</h3>
    <p>28"Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it? 29For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule him, 30saying, 'This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.' </p>
    <p>31"Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? 32If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. 33In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple.</p>

    <h3>John 21:15-17</h3>
    <p>15When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs." </p>
    <p>16Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep." </p>
    <p>17 The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." </p>
    <p>Jesus said, "Feed my sheep.</p>

    <p class="boldMe">Week of April 6 - April 12</p>	
    
    <h3>Luke 4:14-37</h3>
    <p>14Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. 15He taught in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.</p>
    <p>16He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. And he stood up to read. 17The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: 18"The Spirit of the Lord is on me ,because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, 19to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."</p>
    <p>20Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him, 21and he began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."</p>
    <p>22All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked.</p>
    <p>23Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself! Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.' "</p>
    <p>24"I tell you the truth," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his hometown. 25I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land. 26Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. 27And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed-only Naaman the Syrian."</p>
    <p>28All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. 29They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him down the cliff. 30But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.</p>
    <p>31Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath began to teach the people. 32They were amazed at his teaching, because his message had authority.</p>
    <p>33In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, 34"Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are-the Holy One of God!"</p>
    <p>35"Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.</p>
    <p>36All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!" 37And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.</p>

    <h3>John 2:1-12</h3>
    <p>1On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, 2and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. 3When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine."</p>
    <p>4"Dear woman, why do you involve me?" Jesus replied, "My time has not yet come."</p>
    <p>5His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."</p>
    <p>6Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.</p>
    <p>7Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water"; so they filled them to the brim.</p>
    <p>8Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet."</p>
    <p>They did so, 9and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside 10and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."</p>
    <p>11This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.</p>
    <p>12After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.</p>

    <h3>Matthew 3:13-4:11</h3>
    <p>13Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. 14But John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?" </p>
    <p>15Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented. </p>
    <p>16As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. 17And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."</p>
    <p>1Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil. 2After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. 3The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."</p>
    <p>4Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" </p>
    <p>5Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. 6"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: "'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" </p>
    <p>7Jesus answered him, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" </p>
    <p>8Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. 9"All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me."</p>
    <p>10Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'" </p>
    <p>11Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.</p>

    <h3>Hebrews 4:14-16</h3>
    <p>14Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. 15For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are - yet was without sin. 16Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</p>

    <p class="boldMe">Week of March 23-29</p>	
    <p>This week we will be learning about the life and teachings of John the Baptist.  You may have asked yourself: Why did he wander in the desert, was he lost?  Did he need a map?  Why did he wear camel hair clothes, wasn't there an Old Navy nearby?  And of course the every popular: ICK, why would he eat locusts?!?!?  There must have been a McDonald's somewhere!</p>
    
    <h3>Luke 3</h3>
    <p>1In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar -when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene - 2during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert. 3He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 4As is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. 5Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. 6And all mankind will see God's salvation.' "</p>
    <p>7John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 9The axe is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."</p>
    <p>10"What should we do then?" the crowd asked.</p>
    <p>11John answered, "The man with two tunics should share with him who has none, and the one who has food should do the same." </p>
    <p>12Tax collectors also came to be baptized. "Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?" </p>
    <p>13"Don't collect any more than you are required to," he told them. 14Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?"  He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely -be content with your pay." </p>
    <p>15The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ. 16John answered them all, "I baptize you with water. But one more powerful than I will come, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 17His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." 18And with many other words John exhorted the people and preached the good news to them. </p>
    <p>19But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done, 20Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.</p>

    <h3>Matthew 11</h3>
    <p>1After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.</p>
    <p>2When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples 3to ask him, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?" </p>
    <p>4Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see: 5The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. 6Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me." </p>
    <p>7As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? 8If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces. 9Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 10This is the one about whom it is written: " 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' 11I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 12From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it. 13For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. 14And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. 15He who has ears, let him hear.</p>

    <h3>John 1:1-18 (NIV)</h3>
    <p>1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2He was with God in the beginning.</p>
    <p>3Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4In him was life, and that life was the light of men. 5The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. </p>
    <p>6There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. 7He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. 8He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. 9The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. </p>
    <p>10He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. 11He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. 12Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God- 13children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. </p>
    <p>14The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p> 
    <p>15John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' " 16From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. 17For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.</p>
    
    <h3>Philippians 2:5-11 (NIV)</h3>
    <p>5Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:<br />
        6Who, being in very nature God,<br />
        did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,<br />
        7but made himself nothing,<br />
        taking the very nature of a servant,<br />
        being made in human likeness.<br />
        8And being found in appearance as a man,<br />
        he humbled himself<br />
        and became obedient to death-<br />
        even death on a cross!<br />
        9Therefore God exalted him to the highest place<br />
        and gave him the name that is above every name,<br />
        10that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,<br />
        in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br />
        11and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,<br />
        to the glory of God the Father.</p>
